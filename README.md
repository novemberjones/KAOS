**PROVISIONAL DESIGN**  

based on the [Heterodyne Peyote Space Explorer](http://beavisaudio.com/projects/cmossynthesizers)  

**TO CONSIDER:**
- [ ] how many cut-up buttons and where? (everything? each type of everything?)
- [ ] mixing: volume for everything vs. combining some volume controls
- [ ] voltage starving JUST FOR THE HEX INVERTER

see [circuit](circuit) for design.  

_need to figure out haw mony cut-up switches to use and where_  

_possibly add a LM741 amplifier and a distortion circuit_
